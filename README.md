The primary goal of my project is to develop a predictive model that can project a swimmer's career trajectory based on historical trends and influential factors, including times, age, and gender. 
By conducting a comprehensive analysis of historical swimming data, I aim to empower aspiring swimmers with a unique tool that will help them envision their potential journey.
